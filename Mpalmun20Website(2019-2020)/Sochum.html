  The Third Committee of the General Assembly, known as the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee (SOCHUM), is a United Nations body that focuses on a broad spectrum of topics regarding the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
  Essentially guided by the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, this Committee has a wide range of action, and the variety of issues in the social and cultural framework generates collaboration with various organizations (UNESCO, FAO and UNICEF, for instance) that improve the implementation of the Committee's resolutions. Having all UN Member States represented within it, SOCHUM is a forum where negotiation and exchange of experiences between member States is enhanced.
