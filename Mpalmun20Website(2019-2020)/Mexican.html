<p class="cPlus-font">
  The Mexican Drug War  is an  ongoing   asymmetric   low-intensity conflict  between the  Mexican government  and various  drug trafficking syndicates .When the Mexican military began to intervene in 2006, the government's principal goal was to reduce drug-related violence. The Mexican government has asserted that their primary focus is on dismantling the powerful drug cartels, rather than on preventing  drug trafficking  and demand, which is left to U.S. functionaries.<br><br>
  Although Mexican drug trafficking organizations have existed for several decades, their influence increased after the demise of the  Colombian   Cali  and  Medell√≠n  cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale  illicit drug market  and in 2007 controlled 90% of the  cocaine  entering the United States. Arrests of key cartel leaders, particularly in the  Tijuana  and  Gulf  cartels, have led to increasing drug violence as cartels fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United States.
