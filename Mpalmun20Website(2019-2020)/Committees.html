          <p>The General Assembly, which is the main organ of the United Nations and has representation from every UN Member State was established under Chapter IV of the United Nations. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) consists of 6 main committees; and the first of these is the Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC).<br>
          <br>
          DISEC deals with topics that focus on disarmament, global issues, and threats to peace that jeopardize the international security which affect the international community; and seeks out solutions to the challenges in the international security regime. Furthermore, the Article 11 of UN
          Charter states that “The General Assembly may consider the general principles of co- operation in the maintenance of international peace and security, including the principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armament.” which unambiguously denotes the purpose of General Assembly First Committee. In addition, DISEC works closely with the United Nations Disarmament Commission and the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament.</p>

          <p>The Third Committee of the General Assembly, known as the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee (SOCHUM), is a United Nations body that focuses on a broad spectrum of topics regarding the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Essentially guided by the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, this Committee has a wide range of action, and the variety of issues in the social and cultural framework generates collaboration with various organizations
            (UNESCO, FAO and UNICEF, for instance) that improve the implementation of the Committee's resolutions. Having all UN Member States represented within it, SOCHUM is a forum where negotiation and exchange of experiences between member States is enhanced.</p>

          <p>The Fourth Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations is the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, otherwise known as SPECPOL. Established in 1993, SPECPOL is the combination of the Decolonization Committee (formerly the Fourth Committee) and the Special Political Committee. These committees were merged in 1990 when the United Nations established 1990-2000 as the “International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism.”
            This was particularly important considering at the time of the creation of the United Nations, 750 million people lived in colonized territory. Over 80 former colonies have become independent since 1945. Today, in part due to the work of the Fourth Committee, this number has drastically decreased to approximately two million people living in colonized territory, which SPECPOL is still determined to address.</p>

          <p style="font-size:12.25px;">The Mexican Drug War  is an  ongoing   asymmetric   low-intensity conflict  between the  Mexican government  and various  drug trafficking syndicates .When the Mexican military began to intervene in 2006, the government's principal goal was to reduce drug-related violence. The Mexican government has asserted that their primary focus is on dismantling the powerful drug cartels, rather than on preventing  drug trafficking  and demand,
            which is left to U.S. functionaries.
          <br><br>
          Although Mexican drug trafficking organizations have existed for several decades, their influence increased after the demise of the  Colombian   Cali  and  Medellín  cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale  illicit drug market  and in 2007 controlled 90% of the  cocaine  entering the United States. Arrests of key cartel leaders,
          particularly in the  Tijuana  and  Gulf  cartels, have led to increasing drug violence as cartels fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United States.
          <br><br>
          Federal law enforcement has been reorganized at least five times since 1982 in various attempts to control corruption and reduce cartel violence. During that same period, there have been at least four elite  special forces  created as new, corruption-free soldiers who could do battle with Mexico's endemic bribery system. Analysts estimate that  wholesale  earnings from illicit drug sales range from $13.6 to $49.4 billion annually.
          The U.S. Congress passed legislation in late June 2008 to provide Mexico with US$1.6 billion for the  Mérida Initiative  as well as technical advice to strengthen the national justice systems. By the end of  Felipe Calderón's administration (December 1, 2006 – November 30, 2012), the official death toll of the Mexican Drug War was at least 60,000. Estimates set the death toll above 120,000 killed by 2013, not including 27,000 missing. Since taking office,
          Andrés Manuel López Obrador  declared that the war was over; however, his comment was met with criticism as the homicide rate remains high.</p>
