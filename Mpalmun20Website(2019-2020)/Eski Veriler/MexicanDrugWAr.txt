​Mexican Drug War

The Mexican Drug War  is an  ongoing   asymmetric   low-intensity conflict  between the  Mexican government  and various  drug trafficking syndicates .When the Mexican military began to intervene in 2006, the government's principal goal was to reduce drug-related violence. The Mexican government has asserted that their primary focus is on dismantling the powerful drug cartels, rather than on preventing  drug trafficking  and demand, which is left to U.S. functionaries.
 

Although Mexican drug trafficking organizations have existed for several decades, their influence increased after the demise of the  Colombian   Cali  and  Medellín  cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale  illicit drug market  and in 2007 controlled 90% of the  cocaine  entering the United States. Arrests of key cartel leaders, particularly in the  Tijuana  and  Gulf  cartels, have led to increasing drug violence as cartels fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United States.


Federal law enforcement has been reorganized at least five times since 1982 in various attempts to control corruption and reduce cartel violence. During that same period, there have been at least four elite  special forces  created as new, corruption-free soldiers who could do battle with Mexico's endemic bribery system. Analysts estimate that  wholesale  earnings from illicit drug sales range from $13.6 to $49.4 billion annually. The U.S. Congress passed legislation in late June 2008 to provide Mexico with US$1.6 billion for the  Mérida Initiative  as well as technical advice to strengthen the national justice systems. By the end of  Felipe Calderón's administration (December 1, 2006 – November 30, 2012), the official death toll of the Mexican Drug War was at least 60,000. Estimates set the death toll above 120,000 killed by 2013, not including 27,000 missing. Since taking office,  Andrés Manuel López Obrador  declared that the war was over; however, his comment was met with criticism as the homicide rate remains high.
