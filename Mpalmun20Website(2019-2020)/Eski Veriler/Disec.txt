-The Weaponization of Outer Space
-Nuclear Arms Control and Disarmament

The General Assembly, which is the main organ of the United Nations and has representation from every UN Member State was established under Chapter IV of the United Nations. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) consists of 6 main committees; and the first of these is the Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC).
 

DISEC deals with topics that focus on disarmament, global issues, and threats to peace that jeopardize the international security which affect the international community; and seeks out solutions to the challenges in the international security regime. Furthermore, the Article 11 of UN Charter states that “The General Assembly may consider the general principles of co- operation in the maintenance of international peace and security, including the principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armament.” which unambiguously denotes the purpose of General Assembly First Committee. In addition, DISEC works closely with the United Nations Disarmament Commission and the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament.
